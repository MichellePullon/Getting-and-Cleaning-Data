# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
This repository is for submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1. Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
2. Load the activity and feature info
3.Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
4. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
5. Merges the two datasets
6. Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
7. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
8. The end result is shown in the file tidyDataSet.txt.
